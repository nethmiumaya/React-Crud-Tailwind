  <h2 align="center">React CRUD with Redux</h2>
</div>
The `React-Crud-Tailwind` project is a frontend application built using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with state management handled using both Redux and a custom reducer. The project is divided into two branches: `redux` and `reducer`.

## Redux Branch

The `redux` branch utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, which helps manage the application state in a more structured and scalable way.

### Key Features:
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Redux State Management**: Efficient state management using Redux Toolkit.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern and responsive user interface.

### Technologies Used:
- React
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS

## Reducer Branch

The `reducer` branch uses a custom reducer for state management. This approach leverages React's `useReducer` hook to manage the application state locally within the component.

### Key Features:
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Custom Reducer State Management**: State management using React's `useReducer` hook.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern and responsive user interface.

### Technologies Used:
- React
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
